<!-- releases -->

## [0.3.1] — 2026-09-07

- `init --from templates/<name>` resolves inside the installed
  `@foldrun/core` rather than relative to the caller, so a template works
  from any directory.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-07

- Depends on `@foldrun/core` 0.2.0.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-09-06

- Republished after the npm scope wipe; `0.1.x` and `0.2.0`–`0.2.2` are
  burned and cannot be reused.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-05

- `login`, `whoami` and `keys`: sign a machine in, see who it is, manage the
  account's API keys.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-05

First publish: `init`, `check`, `run`, `eval`, `probe`, `logs`, `secrets`,
`deploy`.

[0.3.1]: https://github.com/foldrun-io/foldrun-cli/releases/tag/v0.3.1
